# C-speedups
Faster versions of my existing python programs.

Most of my previous coding experience is with python and sage.  However these have issues with larger simulations/calculations taking too long.
I've been learning C++ in order to be able to more efficiently run calculations I previously implemented in python.  This has been successful; I've been able to calculate some numbers that were previously out of reach on python without using HPC.
